## 🤝 A Bit More

I've been actively trading Steam items particularly CS:GO skins <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/4330185885?pid=83251792505#83251792505" target="_blank">since 2016</a>. Since 2017, my annual trading volume has consistently exceeded RMB 1 million. This hands-on experience has given me deep insights into the Steam marketplace ecosystem and trading mechanics.
